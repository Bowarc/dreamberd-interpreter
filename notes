Scopes

Ast ? idk if it's needed for interpreter

'When' statement, which scope does it uses ? the one where it's defined or the one where it's triggered ?  
'When' statement, triggers when a ref of the variable is changed ? 

About negative lifetimes, we can
- Reorganize the lines to put the line higher 
- At runtime, when trying to access a variable but cannot find it,
  check the rest of the scope for a negative lifetime variable definition
